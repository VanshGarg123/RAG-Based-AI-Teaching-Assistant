I'd be happy to help you with your web development course.

You asked about forms and input tags in HTML. 

In the 7th video of your Sigma web development course, titled "Forms and inputs", we discuss what forms are and how they work in HTML. Specifically, at around 4 seconds into the video (which corresponds to a timestamp of 4.88 seconds), we talk about the `input` tag in forms.

If you want to learn more about forms, input tags, and how they're used in HTML, I'd recommend watching the 7th video.
